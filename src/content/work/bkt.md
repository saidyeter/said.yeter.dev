I'm working on BKT <sub>(as an outsource from [OBSS](https://obss.tech/en/))</sub> migrating old version .Net projects to new version and trying to fix some CI/CD issues in order to make them working in Kubernetes environment. Even so, sometimes I work on developing new features on some projects. 

I'm working with 2 brilliant new grad developers. Working with keen devs makes me energetic. We do presentations and collabrative meetings to make each other up to date.

We are using Jira for task management and GitLab for managing source code
