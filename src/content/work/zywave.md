# Zywave

I worked on integrating newly acquired products to company user and customer management.  
We used Jira for task management and GitLab for managing source code

## Teams

### AgencyMatrix

AgencyMatrix is an Insurance product and written by PHP Phalcon Framework and Laravel. Uses MySQL.  
I worked on integrating AgencyMatrix to Zywave Auth.  
To be able to work in AgencyMatrix, I used Kubernetes with Helm Charts.
