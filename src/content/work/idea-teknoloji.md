I worked on building the new ledger product from scratch and maintaining existing Windows services, ASMX SOAP services, and Web Form portal. The business was invoicing, despatching, ledger management, and other small digital transformation products. We used .Net Core to build new services, RabbitMq for communication between services, and Oracle DB to store data. There were also .Net Framework WCF services for communicating with TR Revenue Administration.
